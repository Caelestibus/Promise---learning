# JavaScript Promise Example

As a Product Manager learning fullstack development, I'm diving into how **JavaScript Promises** work  This repo documents a basic Promise structure and its resolution.

---

###  📜 What This Code Does

Creates a new Promise.

Checks a condition (if (true), which always passes).

If passed, it resolves with "stuff worked".

If failed (change to false), it rejects with "Error, it broke".

.then() handles the success case by logging the result.


### 👩🏾‍💻 Why I Wrote This;

I'm learning how JavaScript handles asynchronous behavior using Promises. As a product manager, this helps me:

Understand how engineers manage async operations

Communicate better about loading states, API calls, and error handling

Think in terms of user experience: success/failure outcomes


### 🧠 What I Learned;

Promises have two outcomes: resolve (success) and reject (failure)

The .then() method runs only if resolved

I can simulate failures by changing the condition in the if statement
